This introduces a minimalist one-page layout that reduces cognitive load and creates a dynamic transition between introduction and gameplay, reinforcing the immediacy of the experience.
   

2. **Mobile-First Responsive Design.**   The interface is fully responsive across all screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed via desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the layout adapts proportionally to ensure that game buttons, scores, and animations remain accessible and visually balanced.
3. **Bold, Playful Aesthetics.**  A lively color scheme‚Äîcomplemented by high-contrast light and dark themes‚Äîensures strong visual clarity and aligns with the energetic nature of the game. These theme options also improve accessibility and personalisation.
4. **Intuitive Interaction and Feedback.**  Visual icons for hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors) are supported by hover states, click animations, and auditory feedback, creating a responsive environment that mimics real-world hand game interactions. 
5. **Micro-Interactions and Transitions.**   Subtle motion effects and transition animations (such as card flips, gesture reveals, and score changes) are used to enhance the perceived quality of the interface, without overwhelming the user or detracting from core functionality.
6. **No-Frills Navigation and Replayability.**  Users are provided with clear calls-to-action (e.g., ‚Äú Game On ‚Äù, ‚ÄúReset Game‚Äù) and minimal navigation barriers. Game sessions can be restarted instantly, promoting repeat engagement with a single click.
7. **Clean, Minimalist UI.**   All visual elements are positioned to reduce clutter and emphasize gameplay. Icons, scores, instructions, and controls are arranged using a grid layout for balanced spatial alignment and simplicity.
8. **Performance Optimisation.**  Images, animations, and JavaScript modules are optimised for quick loading and smooth transitions. Caching strategies and minimal asset bloat were prioritised to maintain seamless performance, even on slower networks.
9.  **Trustworthy, Distraction-Free Environment.**  The site avoids intrusive elements such as advertisements or unnecessary popups. Users are clearly informed upfront that no personal data, login, or downloads are required, which fosters a sense of trust and openness.


### Colour
The overall color palette creates an inviting and user-friendly interface designed to enhance usability, emotional engagement, and thematic consistency.

**Vibrant Magenta/Purple (#990066 to #b30086 range)**
- Used in: Main headings, buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors), and titles like ‚ÄúCHOOSE YOUR WEAPON‚Äù.
- Psychology: Purple and magenta tones often evoke creativity, excitement, and boldness, which are ideal for a casual yet competitive game. It stands out against lighter backgrounds and draws user focus to the game‚Äôs core interactive elements.
- UX Benefit: High contrast against the light background makes buttons and key text highly visible and accessible.

**Soft Lavender/Pastel Pink Background**

- Used in: Background of the entire interface.
Psychology: Light pastel tones provide a calming and non-intimidating atmosphere, which is essential for encouraging casual play and accessibility, especially for younger users or first-time players.
- UX Benefit: This soft hue reduces eye strain while allowing stronger foreground colors (like purple or yellow) to pop effectively.

**Green (#006400 to #228B22)**

- Used in: Labels such as Player, Computer, and the Reset Game link.
- Psychology: Green signifies fair play, progress, and positive action. It reinforces a sense of balance between the player and the computer and subtly invites users to reset and try again.
- UX Benefit: Green is associated with success and restart in digital interfaces, making it intuitive for the user.

**Golden Yellow (#FFD700)**

### JS Lint 
**Code Quality and Validation.**


<img src="./assets/docs/validation/before-JSLint.png">


To ensure the JavaScript code adheres to best practices and is free of common errors, I installed the JSLint extension for Visual Studio Code. This tool automatically analyzes the script and displays any warnings or errors in the editor‚Äôs right panel. I systematically reviewed each reported issue and applied the necessary fixes to improve code quality. 

JSLint reported 18 warnings and errors that required correction. I carefully reviewed each issue and made the necessary code adjustments to ensure compliance with JavaScript best practices and improve overall code quality.
This iterative process was repeated until the code passed JSLint validation without any errors or warnings, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

<img src="./assets/docs/validation/JSLint-compliant.png">


# Game Logic Breakdown

<img src="./assets/images/RPS-FlowChart.svg">

### The game logic was developed using Javascript.

1. **Event-Driven Start**
- **DOMContentLoaded** ensures that the script runs only after the HTML is fully loaded.
  

2. **Intro Transition**
- Clicking the Flip Button: (Game On)
- Adds **.flipped class** to reveal the match screen.
- Plays a ‚Äúwoosh‚Äù transition sound.


3. **Game Initialization**- 
**Function game()** encapsulates all logic and is executed immediately.
 - Initializes:
- Scores
- Audio elements
- DOM references
- Game state **(isGameOver)**

4. **User Interaction Loop**
- **Player clicks a weapon (rock/paper/scissors):**
- The computer generates a random move.
- Both hand images animate.
- After 2 seconds, the hands update and **decideWinner()** is called.


5. **Winner Decision Logic**
- If same choice: draw
- If player wins: increment player score
- If computer wins: increment computer score
- Update the visual scoreboard with animation


6. **Game End Condition**
- **If player or computer reaches 3 points:**
- Game is marked over **(isGameOver = true)**
- Shows victory/defeat message
- Triggers celebration (confetti) or defeat rain (dark confetti)
- Plays special sound


7. **Game Reset**
- The Reset button calls **resetGame():**
- Resets all scores and visual states
- Restores initial hand positions
- Allows replay


The RPS game logic exemplifies a well-structured, modular, event-driven, and state-based design approach. Key functionalities are encapsulated within modular functions such as **updateScoreboard, decideWinner, celebrate**, and **resetGame**, which enhances code maintainability, readability, and ease of testing. The use of animations and audio feedback significantly improves user engagement, making the gameplay experience more interactive and visually appealing. Additionally, the implementation of a game state variable **(isGameOver)** ensures input is effectively disabled once a match concludes, preventing unintended actions and maintaining logical integrity throughout the game flow.

## Credits

### Media
All sound effects used in this project were sourced from <a href="https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/">Pixabay</a>, a platform offering high-quality, royalty-free media. I am grateful to the generous creators who share their work freely for public use.

### Images

The visual assets and game illustrations were designed and created by me using Adobe Illustrator. This allowed for a fully customised interface and ensured a cohesive aesthetic that aligns with the interactive and playful nature of the game.

### Flaticon
The favicon used in this project was sourced from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flaticon</a>, a reputable resource for high-quality vector icons. I then converted the image to .ico format using an online converter to ensure compatibility across browsers, and placed it in the root directory as favicon.ico.

## Development Challenges and Resolutions
### Problem 1: Favicon Icon Not Found

<details><summary><strong>Favicon Icon Not Found</strong></summary>
<img src="./assets/images/Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 05.39.28.png">
</details>

**Issue:**  
The browser attempted to load the favicon (`favicon.ico`) from the default location, but the file was missing. When running the site locally (e.g., via Live Server or localhost), the browser requests:  
`http://127.0.0.1:5502/favicon.ico`  
If the favicon file is absent in the project root, this results in a `404 (Not Found)` error.

**How I fixed it:**  
<img src="./favicon.ico">
1. Added a `favicon.ico` file to the root directory of the project.  
2. Linked the favicon explicitly in the HTML `<head>` section:  

<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

### Problem 2: Broken Player Hand Image Link (Whitespace Issue)
<details><summary><strong>Broken image link</strong></summary>
<img src="./assets/images/Screenshot 2025-06-26 at 05.36.40.png">
</details>

**Issue:**
The game failed to display the player hand image because the constructed image file path contained extraneous whitespace, leading to an invalid URL and a 404 (Not Found) error. For example:
GET http://127.0.0.1:5502/assets/images/ rock .svg 404 (Not Found)

This happened because the player‚Äôs choice was extracted from the button text without trimming whitespace:

const playerChoice = button.textContent.toLowerCase();

If the button‚Äôs label contained spaces (e.g., <button> Rock </button>), the resulting string was " rock " instead of "rock".

**How I fixed it:**
I used .trim() to sanitize the input and remove unwanted whitespace:

const playerChoice = button.textContent.trim().toLowerCase();
This ensured the file path was correctly formed, for example:
./assets/images/rock.svg

### Problem 3: Broken Player Hand Image Link (Whitespace Issue)
<details><summary><strong>Front Card Image Overlapping Back Card</strong></summary>
<img src="./assets/images/image-overlap.png">
</details>

**Issue:**
When deployed on GitHub Pages, the front card remained visible and overlapped the back card during the flip animation, causing a UI glitch.

**How I fixed it:**

Adjusted CSS to properly manage the visibility and layering of card faces during state transitions:

<details><summary><strong>CSS Correction</strong></summary>

</details>


## Lessons Learned

### This development journey was an invaluable learning experience that reinforced several best practices:

- **Meticulous Asset Management:**
Ensuring all static resources like favicons are correctly linked and available prevents avoidable runtime errors and improves the professionalism of the application. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/link#attr-rel">MDN Web Docs - favicon</a>
- **Data Sanitization and Defensive Coding:**
Sanitizing dynamic inputs before use‚Äîsuch as trimming whitespace‚Äîis essential to avoid subtle bugs, especially when those inputs determine critical file paths or UI behavior. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim">JavaScript String.prototype.trim() - MDN</a>
- **Mastering CSS for UI State Control:**
A deep understanding of CSS properties such as z-index, opacity, and pointer-events is crucial to managing UI element visibility and interactivity, particularly in animations and transitions. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index">CSS z-index - MDN</a>
- **Cross-Environment Testing:**
Issues can arise uniquely in different deployment environments. Testing on platforms like GitHub Pages helped identify and fix problems that did not surface in local development. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages Documentation</a>
- **Systematic Debugging Process:**
Approaching errors methodically‚Äîisolating causes, applying targeted fixes, and iterating‚Äîimproves not only the final product but also one‚Äôs troubleshooting skills and code maintainability.
- **Enhancing User Experience Through Visual Polish:**
Correct rendering and smooth transitions are vital for user engagement and convey a sense of quality and attention to detail in the application.

Together, these insights have strengthened my practical skills in frontend development and equipped me to anticipate and resolve similar challenges efficiently in future projects.

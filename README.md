## Design

### Design Choices
The Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game was designed to offer an engaging, responsive, and visually appealing user experience while reflecting the classic simplicity and instant appeal of the original hand game. Key design considerations focused on intuitive interaction, game flow clarity, and playful aesthetics, ensuring both first-time and returning users can navigate and enjoy the platform with ease.

1. **Animated Flipcard Interface.**  The landing page is structured as a single card that flips seamlessly into the game view. This introduces a minimalist one-page layout that reduces cognitive load and creates a dynamic transition between introduction and gameplay, reinforcing the immediacy of the experience.
   

2. **Mobile-First Responsive Design.**   The interface is fully responsive across all screen sizes and devices. Whether accessed via desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the layout adapts proportionally to ensure that game buttons, scores, and animations remain accessible and visually balanced.
3. **Bold, Playful Aesthetics.**  A lively color scheme‚Äîcomplemented by high-contrast light and dark themes‚Äîensures strong visual clarity and aligns with the energetic nature of the game. These theme options also improve accessibility and personalisation.
4. **Intuitive Interaction and Feedback.**  Visual icons for hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors) are supported by hover states, click animations, and auditory feedback, creating a responsive environment that mimics real-world hand game interactions. 
5. **Micro-Interactions and Transitions.**   Subtle motion effects and transition animations (such as card flips, gesture reveals, and score changes) are used to enhance the perceived quality of the interface, without overwhelming the user or detracting from core functionality.
6. **No-Frills Navigation and Replayability.**  Users are provided with clear calls-to-action (e.g., ‚Äú Game On ‚Äù, ‚ÄúReset Game‚Äù) and minimal navigation barriers. Game sessions can be restarted instantly, promoting repeat engagement with a single click.
7. **Clean, Minimalist UI.**   All visual elements are positioned to reduce clutter and emphasize gameplay. Icons, scores, instructions, and controls are arranged using a grid layout for balanced spatial alignment and simplicity.
8. **Performance Optimisation.**  Images, animations, and JavaScript modules are optimised for quick loading and smooth transitions. Caching strategies and minimal asset bloat were prioritised to maintain seamless performance, even on slower networks.
9.  **Trustworthy, Distraction-Free Environment.**  The site avoids intrusive elements such as advertisements or unnecessary popups. Users are clearly informed upfront that no personal data, login, or downloads are required, which fosters a sense of trust and openness.


### Colour
The overall color palette creates an inviting and user-friendly interface designed to enhance usability, emotional engagement, and thematic consistency.

**Vibrant Magenta/Purple (#990066 to #b30086 range)**
- Used in: Main headings, buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors), and titles like ‚ÄúCHOOSE YOUR WEAPON‚Äù.
- Psychology: Purple and magenta tones often evoke creativity, excitement, and boldness, which are ideal for a casual yet competitive game. It stands out against lighter backgrounds and draws user focus to the game‚Äôs core interactive elements.
- UX Benefit: High contrast against the light background makes buttons and key text highly visible and accessible.

**Soft Lavender/Pastel Pink Background**

- Used in: Background of the entire interface.
Psychology: Light pastel tones provide a calming and non-intimidating atmosphere, which is essential for encouraging casual play and accessibility, especially for younger users or first-time players.
- UX Benefit: This soft hue reduces eye strain while allowing stronger foreground colors (like purple or yellow) to pop effectively.

**Green (#006400 to #228B22)**

- Used in: Labels such as Player, Computer, and the Reset Game link.
- Psychology: Green signifies fair play, progress, and positive action. It reinforces a sense of balance between the player and the computer and subtly invites users to reset and try again.
- UX Benefit: Green is associated with success and restart in digital interfaces, making it intuitive for the user.

**Golden Yellow (#FFD700)**

- Used in: The score count for both Player and Computer.
Psychology: Yellow evokes energy, attention, and alertness, ideal for highlighting dynamic elements like scores.
- UX Benefit: Easily catches the user's eye and signifies real-time change, keeping users informed about game status.

**Black/Grey (#333333)**

- Used in: Footer text for legal and branding content.
- Reasoning: This subtle but readable contrast anchors the footer information without competing with the main content.


### Fonts

**Acme (Headlines & Buttons) ‚Äî Adds Playfulness**
- Game-like personality: Acme's rounded, bold letterforms convey a fun, casual, and energetic tone‚Äîperfect for a game targeting users of all ages, especially younger audiences or casual players.
- Attention-grabbing: Ideal for use in titles like ‚ÄúRock! Paper! Scissors!‚Äù, scoreboard headings, or call-to-action buttons like ‚ÄúPlay Again.‚Äù
- Web-optimized: Loads fast from Google Fonts and maintains quality on all screen sizes.

**Helvetica (Body, Instructions, UI) ‚Äî Ensures Clarity**
- Clean and timeless: Helvetica‚Äôs neutral design ensures the interface stays readable, even during fast-paced interactions.
- Widely supported: Helvetica is a system font on many devices, which improves performance and reduces font flickering.
- Professional balance: While Acme plays up the fun, Helvetica brings the visual balance and polish your site needs to appear well-structured.
